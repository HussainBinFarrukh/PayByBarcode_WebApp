    <p>It all began when one of our team mate went to get some chicken tenders. After devouring those juciy tenders he realized he forgot his wallet! And so he asked the nice waitress if he can pay with 'apple pay' but unfortunatly the restaurant did not have that yet!! So he took matters in his own hands.</p>
